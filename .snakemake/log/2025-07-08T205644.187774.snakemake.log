MissingOutputException in rule build_twopaco  in line 42 of /mnt/c/Users/anand/Documents/Academics/S4/22BIO211- INTELLIGENCE OF BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS II/Project/metagenome_quantification/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/twopaco/unitigs.fasta completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 0
Removing output files of failed job build_twopaco since they might be corrupted:
results/twopaco/ecoli_cdbg.gfa
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
